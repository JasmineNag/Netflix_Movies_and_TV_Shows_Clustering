This repository contains a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows, along with a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to cluster the dataset using Python and scikit-learn. The dataset includes information about each title's title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, and listed in multiple genres.
